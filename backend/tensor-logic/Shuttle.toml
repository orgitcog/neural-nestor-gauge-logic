# Include dist files in deployment (dist/ is gitignored, so we need to explicitly include it)
# Note: According to Shuttle docs, specifying only a folder name doesn't work - use "dist/*" instead
# The dist folder is built in GitHub Actions before deployment
# No hook scripts (shuttle_prebuild.sh, shuttle_postbuild.sh) are used - frontend is built in CI
